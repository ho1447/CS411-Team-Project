As a full time student, I want to save some interesting recipes to make later, so that I know what recipes to cook when I don’t know what to eat or get from the store. This requires me to log into the app order for the app to save the recipes I want. I want to save different recipes into different recipe lists. I would also like to share my list of saved recipes, as well as browse other people’s list of saved recipes. This user story shows that we need to be able to hold previous entries for future use.
