I want to be able to use the ingredients I have in the most effective manner, so that I waste as little time and money as possible. I also want to listen to some sick tunes at the same time. This web app will allow me to find the cheapest recipe available with a given set of ingredients. After putting in my ingredient information, the website will pull recipes and calculate a price, returning the cheapest recipe. At the same time, the web app will give me a playlist of music to listen to while I cook. This way, I do not need to spend extra time to find a recipe and potentially spend money on buying unnecessary ingredients. The song also creates a fun cooking environment for me by playing songs related to the recipe, making the cooking process less boring.
