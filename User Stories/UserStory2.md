I am a conductor of a very prominent orchestra. I want to listen to music while cooking and therefore want a playlist at the same time. I want to be able to enter my ingredients and get a couple recipes for myself as well as a playlist. Usually, cooking is a chore and confusing process so the playlist as well as the quick access to recipes, makes it less of a hassle. As a result, I achieve my original goal of getting a playlist while cooking, as the webapp picks my meal and generates a playlist at the same time.
