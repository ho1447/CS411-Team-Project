As a high school student, I want to be able to cook food after school using the ingredients in my house because I do not have money or cooking experience, therefore, I need help finding a recipe. This user story covers the requirement of ease of usage, where not much information is needed other than ingredient data. My goals of minimizing cost and recipe selection are achieved, as my experience in cooking isnâ€™t required for the recipe selection and the webapp minimizes the cost of my meal by only using ingredients I already own.
